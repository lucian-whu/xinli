            <p>I'm a computer science engineer with a keen interest in solving real world problems. Currently interning at Tonbo Imaging, working on real time computer vision of thermal video and delving deep into the Android camera stack. I studied my B.Tech at <a href="http://daiict.ac.in/">DA-IICT</a>, where I had taken Computer Science and IoT as my electives. I have worked with various MIT Media Lab personnel in the past, developed an Android application with over 250K installs, heavily contributed to an Android launcher with over 1 million installs, and contribute to open source actively.</p>

            <li><b>[Internship, Tonbo Imaging]</b> I am working on various components of the Android camera stack and delving into computer vision. I worked on streaming thermal videos over RTP protocol between server and client Qualcomm Snapdragon boards running Android OS. <br>I also created a computer vision algorithm to detect+track bodies and faces in thermal videos. I used HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) features fed into an SVM classifier. The tracking was done using an optical flow (KLT algorithm). 
            <br>The entire codebase is a mixture of C++, C and Java, all functioning together. This is being done using Java Native Interface, that allows running C/C++ code within Java. This was done to maintain a high fps of the streamed video. </li>
            <li><b>[Research, Spatio-Temporal Dataset]</b> Co-published a paper on studying the role of temporal diversity in inferring social ties based on spatio-temporal data. We created a rich spatio-temporal dataset of 0.7 million datapoints of continuous location data logged at an interval of every 2 minutes by mobile phones of 46 subjects. Our research is focused at inferring relationship strength between students based on the spatiotemporal data and comparing the results with the self-reported data. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03298">Read the paper here</a>.</li>
            <li><b>[Android, LifeHacks]</b> Developed an Android application that now has over <b>250K+</b> downloads on the playstore <b>(4.7 stars with >3K ratings, over 60% active users, as of December '16).</b> It is the top app in its category on the Play Store, and is growing at ~1-5K downloads per day. The application uses content from the website 1000lifehacks.com, but am now shifting to a crowdsourced mode - allowing users to submit, rate and report lifehacks. Note : I have temporarily removed the app from the playstore due to the extreme growth of the app, but it will be up again around March '17.</li>
            <!--I am also working on translating the lifehacks to different languages by crowdsourcing the same.-->
            <li><b>[Android, Lens Launcher]</b> Contributed heavily to an open source Android launcher with over 400K (as of Sept '16) downloads. The application can be found <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nickrout.lenslauncher">here</a>. The application is based on a graphical fish eye lens algorithm, allowing you to browse through all your apps on a single page. The source code and graphical fisheye lens academic resources are on <a href="https://github.com/nicholasrout/lens-launcher/">Github</a>.</li>
            <li><b>[Hill Hacks, Dharamshala]</b> Spent two weeks (May '16) at a hacker space in Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh - <a href="https://hillhacks.in/">HillHacks</a>. I learnt a lot about hacker spaces, the concept, and scene in India and in Germany. I also met and interacted with a lot of people from diverse fields - architecture, space tech, design, animals enthusiasts, hacker space owner, and several others.</li>
            <li><b>[Internship, Health-Kiosk, IoT]</b> Working with <a href="http://anirudh.me/">Anirudh Sharma</a> and <a href="http://www.niteshkadyan.in/">Nitesh Kadyan</a> at developing a portable health kiosk that measures the 5 vitals signs of a human being. Also worked on an interface to democratize sensors to all platforms - reading data from sensors on an Android device using the audio jack.</li>
            <li><b>[Internship, 360Â° camera, IoT]</b> Working at <a href="http://360vr.tesseract.in/">Tesseract</a>, an MIT Media Lab spinoff working closely with <a href="http://www.kshitijmarwah.com/ ">Kshitij Marwah</a>, where I co-developed an Android application to capture and view 360 degree image+video with the hardware built there.</li>
            <li><b>[Smart Kumbhmela, Nasik]</b> At <a href="http://www.kumbha.org/">Kumbathon</a> for 10 days as a participant, where I worked with <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/raskar">Ramesh Raskar</a> towards bringing technology to the Kumbhmela. We visualized changes in population movement on heatmaps, using telecom data.</li>
            <!-- <li><b>[Machine Learning, NLP, OCR]</b> Worked with the famous <a href="http://facebook.com/terriblytinytales">Terribly Tiny Tales</a> page - several 100 character stories, where I aimed at understanding which tales receive most likes/type of comments, applying sentiment analysis to each tale. This was by far my most interesting project in terms of ML. You can read more about it <a href="">here</a></li> -->
            <li><b>[Android, Udacity Nanodegree]</b> Amongst the top thousand in the nation to obtain a one year scholarship from Google and Tata Trusts for Udacity's Nanodegree course in Android Development.</li>

Have a look at <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rish.crearo.lifehacks">LifeHacks</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.memions.quotes">The Minions App</a>. The applications have 60K+ and 10K+ downloads (as of Sept '16) each.</li>
            <li><b>[Android, Zimbra Webmail]</b> A GMail like Android application for <a href="http://webmail.daiict.ac.in/">Zimbra Webmail</a>, our university email service. <a href=" https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sigmobile.dawebmail">The application</a> is used by >1k students regularly. The application has been completely open sourced. The application can be used by any organization using Zimbra Webmail. View the source code <a href="https://github.com/crearo/webmail">here</a>. Do go through the README.md</li>
            <li><b>[Android, Alarm for the Lazy]</b> An Android application that allows you to set multiple alarms in gaps of 5/10/15 minutes, to make sure you wake up tomorrow morning. The application was developed in my sophomore year to make it easier for me to set multiple alarms in intervals of 10 minutes in one go (I was missing a lot of classes because of not waking up on time then) <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rish.crearo.alarmmanager">Alarm for the Lazy - Playstore</a>.</li>
            <li><b>[Android, Drunk Call Blocker]</b> An Android application that allows you to blocks calls and smses before getting drunk. Inspired from the movie the Internship. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Crearo">Drunk Much?</a>.</li>
